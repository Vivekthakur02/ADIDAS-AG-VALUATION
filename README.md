<p align="center">
  <b>Comprehensive Valuation of Adidas AG using DCF-based Methods (FCFF, CCF, and ECF)</b><br>
  <i>Major Project by Vivek Thakur | IIT Kharagpur</i>
</p>

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This repository contains the financial valuation of **Adidas AG**, one of the world’s largest sportswear companies.  
The objective is to estimate the company’s **Enterprise Value (EV)** and derive its **fair stock price** using  
different discounted cash flow (DCF) approaches.

This README currently covers **Step 1: Objective & Basic Understanding**.  
Subsequent steps (like FCFF, WACC, and final valuation) will be added later as updates.

## 🎯 Step 1 — Objective & Basic Understanding

### 🧭 Project Objective
To determine the **true value of Adidas AG** by calculating its **Enterprise Value (EV)** and comparing it with  
the company’s **market value**, helping to identify whether the stock is **undervalued or overvalued**.

---

### 💡 What Is Enterprise Value (EV)?
EV represents the **total worth of a company**, including both shareholders’ and debt-holders’ interests.  
It’s the price one would effectively pay to acquire the entire company.

\[
\text{EV} = \text{Market Capitalisation} + \text{Total Debt} - \text{Cash \& Cash Equivalents}
\]

- **Market Cap** = Share price × Number of shares  
- **Total Debt** = Short-term + Long-term debt  
- **Cash & Equivalents** = Company’s liquid funds  

EV gives a **complete picture** of a company’s value — not just what shareholders own,  
but also what lenders are owed.

### 🧮 Valuation Methods Used
This project uses three complementary DCF-based valuation approaches:

| Method | Meaning (Simplified) | Focus |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **FCFF** | Free Cash Flow to Firm – cash available to all investors before paying interest | Measures total firm value |
| **CCF** | Capital Cash Flow – variation considering both equity & debt cash flows | Adjusts for tax shields |
| **ECF** | Equity Cash Flow – cash available to equity holders after paying interest & debt | Focuses on shareholder value |

All three methods ultimately lead to an estimated **Enterprise Value** and implied **fair stock price**.

---

## 🧩 Step 2 — Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)

### 💡 Concept

Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) represents the **cash generated from operations that is available to all providers of capital** — both debt and equity holders.
It tells us how much cash the business truly produces after paying for its regular operations and investments in assets.

---

### 🧾 Formula

FCFF} = EBIT*(1 - Tax Rate) + Depreciation - CAPEX - ΔWorking Capital 

---

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Tax)**
   Operating profit before financing and tax expenses. Taken directly from the income statement.

2. **(1 − Tax Rate)**
   Adjusts EBIT for taxes to find after-tax operating income.
   → In our model, the effective tax rate used = **27.4 %**

3. **+ Depreciation**
   Non-cash accounting expense added back since it doesn’t reduce cash.

4. **− CAPEX (Capital Expenditure)**
   Cash spent on new plants, machinery, or technology. This is an actual cash outflow.

5. **− Δ Working Capital**
   Measures additional cash locked in day-to-day operations.
   In our project, **change in working capital = 0** was assumed for simplicity.

### 🧮 Illustrative Computation (Adidas 2023)

| Item              | Value (€ million)         | Note             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| EBIT              | 1,190                     | Operating profit |
| Tax rate          | 27.4 %                    | Given            |
| EBIT after tax    | 1,190 × (1 − 0.274) = 864 | –                |
| Depreciation      | 700                       | Added back       |
| CAPEX             | 510                       | Subtracted       |
| Δ Working Capital | 0                         | Assumed –        |

[
\text{FCFF} = 864 + 700 - 510 - 0 = \textbf{€ 1,054 million}
]

---

### 💬 Interpretation

Adidas generated roughly **€ 1.05 billion of free cash flow** in 2023 — the cash available to both debt and equity holders after accounting for its operating and investment needs.
This serves as the base year cash flow for projecting future values in the DCF model.

### 📊 Key Inputs Required
Before proceeding to valuation, the following data points are collected:

- **Financial Statements:** Revenue, EBITDA, EBIT, Net Income  
- **Depreciation & Amortisation**  
- **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)**  
- **Change in Working Capital** (assumed zero in this project)  
- **Total Debt & Cash Balance**  
- **Tax Rate:** 27.4 %  
- **Interest Rate:** 2.48 %  
- **Discount Rate (WACC):** to be calculated later  
- **Shares Outstanding** & any **Buybacks**
