## 🧭 Step 1 — Objective & Basic Understanding

### 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to **find the true value of Adidas AG** by calculating its **Enterprise Value (EV)** and using it to determine the company’s **fair share price**.  
This helps identify whether Adidas is **undervalued or overvalued** compared to its market price.

### 💡 What Is Enterprise Value (EV)?
Think of EV as the **total worth of the company** if someone were to buy the entire business — including debt and excluding excess cash.

\[
\text{EV} = \text{Market Capitalisation} + \text{Total Debt} - \text{Cash & Cash Equivalents}
\]

- **Market Cap** = Share price × Number of shares  
- **Total Debt** = Short-term + Long-term debt  
- **Cash & Equivalents** = Company’s available liquid funds  

EV gives a **complete picture** of the company’s value — not just what shareholders own, but also what lenders are owed.

### 🧮 Valuation Methods Used
In this project, three valuation models are used (to be explained in later steps):
1. **FCFF (Free Cash Flow to Firm)** — cash available to all investors before paying interest.  
2. **CCF (Capital Cash Flow)** — a variation considering both equity and debt cash flows.  
3. **ECF (Equity Cash Flow)** — cash available only to shareholders after paying interest and debt.

All three methods lead to estimating Adidas’s **Enterprise Value**, then comparing it with the **actual market value**.

### 📊 Key Inputs Required
Before starting the valuation, we collect and prepare the following:
- **Financial statements:** Revenue, EBITDA, EBIT, Net Income  
- **Depreciation & Amortisation**  
- **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)**  
- **Change in Working Capital** (assumed zero in our project)  
- **Total Debt & Cash balance**  
- **Tax rate:** 27.4%  
- **Interest rate:** 2.48%  
- **Discount rate (WACC)** — will be derived later  
- **Number of shares outstanding** and any **buybacks**

---

### 📈 Step 1 Summary
- The project’s goal is to **value Adidas AG** using DCF-based models (FCFF, CCF, and ECF).  
- The main target metric is **Enterprise Value (EV)**.  
- EV captures the company’s total worth, including debt and cash adjustments.  
- This step sets the foundation for financial calculations and forecasting in upcoming steps.
